Bollywood Celebrity Predictor is an AI-powered application designed to identify which Bollywood celebrity a user most closely resembles. The project leverages advanced deep learning techniques, using VGGFace (ResNet50) for feature extraction and MTCNN for accurate face detection. By comparing user-uploaded images with a pre-trained database of Bollywood celebrity images, the system calculates cosine similarity to determine the closest match.

The application is built with Streamlit, offering a simple and interactive user interface. Users can upload their images, and the system automatically detects their faces, extracts facial features, and matches them against a celebrity database. The project is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time deployment on cloud platforms.
